        <h1 style="text-align: center;color: #800000; line-height: 2.9rem;">Why is studying abroad in Finland a whole lot cheaper than in the US?</h1>
        <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may not be a surprise to say &ldquo;Finland has got a high standard for education&rdquo; but some may argue that &rdquo;study abroad in Finland&rdquo; will beat &ldquo;study abroad in the USA&rdquo; (especially those foreign students living in the USA). However, this post will tell you why Finland may be a better choice for some students - especially for those &ldquo;students living on a budget&rdquo;.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DISCLAIMER: the purpose of this post is to prove that studying in Finland might be a better choice for international students. We do not state that education in the USA is not good nor will it be a bad thing to study abroad in the USA. In fact, we love how to open the US is and the USA quality standard is one of the best in the world but Finland just provides an even greater environment and advantages for International students.</span></p>
        <p><strong>First, we will compare the cost of living and the quality of life. Then we'll</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> talk about the study</span><strong> environment and work opportunities in both countries so the reader can get a clear understanding of the situation.</strong></p><br>
        
        <h3 style="color: #000000;">1. For students who are studying and paying tuition by themselves, it is always the utmost importance to find out about the tuition fee and any extra fees related to the cost of living:</h3>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average tuition fee in the US (2019) is a little bit over $35,000 USD per year for a private University for a bachelor degree (source: </span><a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/student-finance/how-much-does-it-cost-study-us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">topuniversities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)&nbsp;</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the tuition fee in Finland without a scholarship is about &euro;10 000 per year for the same degree and it is worth mentioning that most students who applied for a UAS in Finland automatically receive a 50% tuition fee scholarship if they complete 60ECTS per academic year (read more about our </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finland Scholarship Hunting guide in 2021</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some talented students will be able to grab a scholarship that cover 100% tuition fee, there is another problem to solve which is the Cost of living</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For $11000 USD per year in private schools, foreign students in the US will be able to live in the dorm and share everything with their dorm mates.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, the student associations in Finland provide way more options for University students in Finland with rooms more spacious and rent cheaper with everything included in the rent no matter which school you study in. The shared flat private room for a student in Finland is around &euro;240 and it only costs &euro;400 for a studio.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is quite obvious that the tuition fee + cost of living in Finland will be only about half of what an international student must spend in the USA. And for most students, this is a made or break in the deal, considering so many graduate students are unable to get employed after they finish their study and are deep in tuition debts.</span></p>
        
        <h3>2. About quality of life in Finland and the European countries, it would be understandable to say they are at a higher quality in comparison to life in the United States. Because students will get more space in Finland, less chinese imported foods and cleaner air and less pollution in the environment.</h3>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One more benefit of studying in Finland rather than in the USA is that students who have a big heart for travelling will be able to</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">tour the whole 26 countries</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Schengen region without applying for an additional visa permit. This is such a dream for international students like us who are always free at heart and would love to explore every part of the world.</span></p>
        
        <h3>3. We didn&rsquo;t talk about the education level&rsquo;s difference in both countries because we believed both Finland and the USA have some of the best education systems in the world. But if we zoom in a little bit closer we can see why studying in Finland brings a bit of fresh air and an edge over the US.</h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">a)<em> Firstly</em>, education in Finland is considered independent and self-taught with practical training in the final year rather than pushing too many tasks on the students, sometimes even the professors feel bad about giving too much homework to their students. On the contrary, it is rather fierce in the USA regarding assignments and quizzes and tests which a student must do to complete the course.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">b) <em>Secondly</em>, there is no research showing that more homework equals better qualified graduate students in life, the act of stressing over homework and getting lost in their study just to pass an exam does not seem very effective. So it might even play a bad impact on the independent thinking skill of the students and the ability to invest more time and effort on the right career path of an individual.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">c) <em>Thirdly</em>, even though Finnish is the mother tongue in Finland, the majority of Finnish citizens will be able to speak English to strangers and they are very willing to assist if needed. Therefore studying in Finland or USA will have no difference in language barrier for international students who English is not their first language.</span></p>
        
        <h3>4. Finally, let&rsquo;s talk about work opportunities for foreign students after graduation. This may be the only hurdle that a student would need to be prepared for when studying abroad in Finland since even though Finnish people are friendly and nice, they request their colleagues to be able to speak Finnish at work. So it is a vital requirement for foreign students to spend time learning Finnish in their free time before graduation.</h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in our opinion, it is only fair for any individual who would like to settle in Finland to learn how to speak their language. Students have plenty of time before and during their university time to learn to speak Finnish and integrate into Finnish society. Otherwise, a degree in Finland is considered valid and valuable for the whole europe and in many other parts of the world so graduated students will have the choice to stay after graduation or move to another English-speaking country to work at.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finnish is difficult</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but we come prepared and already provide our precious readers with the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">best study guides in the world </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">- or not, maybe we are just trying to make it easier and less painful to speak the Finnish language!</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studying in Finland can be quite the dream and fun adventure for International students who would like to study in Europe in English. You just need to follow our guidelines carefully and don&rsquo;t step back. Everything is easy and people are super friendly yet the cost of living and the tuition fee is just a whole lot cheaper than anywhere else in the west. So what are we still hesitating for? Let&rsquo;s go and apply for</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">the university of your dreams in Finland</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or read more about our &ldquo;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life in Finland for international students</span></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; or &ldquo;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to travel Finland in a budget?</span></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;</span></p>
