		<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>TOP 10 DON&rsquo;Ts IN FINLAND</strong></span></h1>
        <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
        <p>Finland is very famous as a modern and civilized country. Many people here are very surprised at what people treat each other and how they communicate in society.</p>
        <p><span>Finns very much respect the awareness and perception of one individual that they can evaluate that person. For that, many foreigners may get in trouble with the way to act in Finland at the first time.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will give you 10 things that you shouldn&rsquo;t do in Finland to avoid bad impression when living there with the local</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>1) Interrupt the conversation</strong></span></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the rudest actions in Finns&rsquo; eyes. They hate being interrupted by others and consider it as impoliteness. In Finland, interruption is unacceptable although in many countries, we don&rsquo;t mind that.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For that, you should listen carefully and wait till the speakers stop.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>2) Being late</strong></span></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finns are very punctual because to them, time is respectful and meaningful. They don&rsquo;t like waiting for others. Therefore, in the meetings, they will start at the exact time. If you are later, you will receive some bad impressions from other colleagues as well as your manager.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid this bad, you just need to well-arrange your timetable and willing to be in time (before the setting time 5-10 minutes)</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">3) Compare Finland with other countries</span></strong></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finns are those who have strong national strong-respect. They are proud of all their wartime achievements and significant sporting merits. For that, they seem don&rsquo;t like the comparison, especially Swedish and Russian. As the historic events, Swedish and Russian are used to invade their country, so they are not completely have a good sight of these two countries. Also, in sports, you should try to avoid commenting on their hockey team and comparing it with Swedish team. It seems very rude.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need to do is try to control your saying and make as many true compliments for them as you can.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>4) Break the social distance?</strong></span></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finns are very famous for their social distance. The privacy in the public is always respected. In some public areas, such as: bus station, supermarkets, they try to keep the distance to each other of 4,7 inches, which seems very far to Asian. Moreover, don&rsquo;t try to access them if you are not related to them. But asking for the direction is acceptable.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should notice this point because it will take place in every moment in your daily life.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>5) Impolite with women</strong></span></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women are treated equally to men in either business or home. Finns give a respectful view to the women and are proud of many women heroes in their countries. Sometimes, women may be treated much better than men like in a couple, women are always greeted first. For that reason, any impoliteness or gender racism is considered as rude and disregarded.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be always polite and kind to women in Finland, you will make good impressions.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>6) Eating before the host</strong></span></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever you are invited to the private party, it is necessary to notice the rituals sequences to behave correctly. You should not eat until all food is served as well as drink until the wishing from the host. It is more appreciated if you start your meals after the host.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be humble and notice anything in the party will give you the right behaviours.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>7) Show strong emotion</strong></span></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You shouldn&rsquo;t show your strong emotion, because Finns view this as unprofessional. Moreover, strong emotion may harm your relationship and your business.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to be calm and cooperative to decide the most reasonable key.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>8) Over-tip</strong></span></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paying tips is so familiar in many countries that paying an extra amount to the server. But in Finland, not all services receive tips from you. Especially when you over-tipping in some places, the server will not know how to react and believe that you are making a mistake.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases that you are in doubt about tipping, don&rsquo;t hesitate to simply ask them whether a tip is accepted here.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>9) Be bragging</strong></span></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finns are very modest and frank in spite of their great achievement. For that, they also don&rsquo;t like people who are bragging too much. They especially have a low tolerance of self-important braggarts. Therefore, they highly evaluate the modesty from others and consider it as one of the essential characteristics in daily life and business as well</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While interacting with Finns, try to avoid bragging yourself too much that they will have a bad impression with you instead of the good one you want to gain.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>10) Small talk</strong></span></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finns don&rsquo;t like small talk because it makes the story go awkward. If you want to say anything, just go straight to the issues, and if you don&rsquo;t know what to say, silence is much appreciated. Your talk must be the elevator, not to mark something to the speaker.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid this, you need to carefully think of the conversation before hold that to the speakers because it must be valued to both of you.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
