        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people travel somewhere, they tend to research and find out specific foods in that place to try, enjoy.&nbsp;</span></em></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finland is always one of the happiest countries in the world, people are satisfied with their lives and policies from the government. Does food have some strong influences on that?&nbsp;</span></em></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will recommend for you - traveller, international student some traditional foods you should try when coming to Finland.&nbsp;</span></em></li>
        </ol>
        <p><br /><br /></p>
        <h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LIST ITEMS:</span> </strong></h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Travelling around the world is now easier and more convenient than the past many times due to the development of transportations, especially planes, subway and infrastructure. People can go and start a trip anywhere, anytime they want, all they need are time and financial resources.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ul>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of elements which attract tourists to come, enjoy and choose that place for their vacation such as culture, festivals, people, interesting destinations, food &amp; drink (cuisine).</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The destination is the main reason for making a place or country popular and well-known. Depending on the age and people&rsquo;s hoppy, they will choose natural destinations such as an ecotourism area, forest for flora and fauna conservation, natural areas with few people or some modern and hectic places like amusement parks, high-tech games and exhibitions.</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides interesting destinations, visitors also come to a country by its cuisine, especially traditional food. As you know that each nation will have its own cuisine culture and recipe which make their dishes different from others&rsquo; ones. People often say that cuisine is the quintessence of a nation because it is a mixture of classical and modern. The cuisine is not only a long-standing cooking secret, but it is also the best evidence of the combination of culture and customs of that country. What a pity if you travel to a country, but you don&rsquo;t have a chance to try traditional food there.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.&nbsp;</span>Finnish cuisine is not an exception. The title "the happiest country in the world" does not come from well-equipped infrastructure, social policy, people's awareness but also comes from the food, what they eat every day. According to an article, delicious foods are also an element which makes Finnish people happy with their life because when they eat those foods, they are assured of the health and quality of the products. An example is that Finnish wild forest berries, agricultural plants and livestock are cultivated and grown in the clean arctic air with very limited need for pesticides. The result is the dense and unique taste of Finnish food.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3.&nbsp;Here we go to some specific dishes which are common and unique in Finland. They are recommended by a lot of people who have tried them before.</p>
