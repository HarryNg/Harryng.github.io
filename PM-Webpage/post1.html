        <br><h4>To sum up: </h4>
        <br>There are not as many scholarships for bachelor degree students as there are for master degrees in English.
        <br><br>All International students will automatically be eligible for 50% scholarship as long as they complete their study with 60ECTS per academic year - it is already a lot cheaper than the tuition fee in the USA and Canada
        <br><br>UAS will be more practical and provide more support for job seeking students after graduation.
        <br><br>University will provide the most talented foreign Students with 100% scholarship and some cost of living if they are selected and complete 55 - 60 ECTS per academic year.
        <br><br>
        <h4>How to find and apply for a scholarship for English speaking International Students?</h4>
        <br>There are two places where you can hunt for a Finland scholarship<br><br>

            <li>Decide which schools are best for your study</li>
            <li>Note down the requirements and time of admission</li>
            <li>Apply for a scholarship together with the admission application</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>CONCLUSION:	</h3>
        <br>Getting a scholarship for international students in Finland wasn’t so hard after all. You just need to follow our guidelines and be prepared for all the requirements that the school requests. It is already super easy to get a 50% scholarship and most of the tuition fees are considered a lot cheaper than other countries.
