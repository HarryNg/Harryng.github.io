		  <p class="review-head">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly feel i got every penny's worth.</p>
		  <p class="review-body">"I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have herad some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

		  <p class="review-head">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy."</p>
		  <p class="review-body">"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which i find really interesting. The problem gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people." </p>

		 <p class="review-head">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
		 <p class="review-body">"Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed some tructure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disaapoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
